    <h1>Statistic Selection and MCMC for Differentially Private Bayesian Estimation</h1>
    <p>This work mainly addresses two problems: (1) What statistic of the sample should be shared privately? For the first question, i.e., the one about statistic selection, we promote using the Fisher information. We find out that, the statistic that is most informative in a non-privacy setting may not be the optimal choice under the privacy restrictions. We provide several examples to support that point. We consider several types of data sharing settings and propose several Monte Carlo-based numerical estimation methods for calculating the Fisher information for those settings. The second question concerns inference: (2) Based on the shared statistics, how could we perform effective Bayesian inference?</p>
